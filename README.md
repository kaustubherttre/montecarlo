# montecarlo
This is the code for the famous Monte Carlo simulator to predict stock prices. The code is written in python using various libraries like pandas, numpy ,matplotlib
 
This is a python program developed in Jupyter Notebook. Although the program should run if you run withoyt making any changes but sometimes
there might a problem with the DataReader library of python, if there is you can change 'yahoo' to 'google' which basically means you would be getting information from google finance rather than yahoo finance
